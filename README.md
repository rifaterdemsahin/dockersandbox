## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have a GitHub account.
- You have access to GitHub Codespaces.
- Basic knowledge of Docker and containerization.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/docker-sandbox-testing.git
    cd docker-sandbox-testing
    ```

2. **Open the repository in GitHub Codespaces:**

    - Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
    - Click on the `Code` button and select `Open with Codespaces`.
    - Create a new Codespace or open an existing one.

3. **Set up the Docker environment:**

    - Codespaces should have Docker pre-installed. Verify by running:

    ```bash
    docker --version
    ```

## Usage

### Building a Docker Image

To build a Docker image from the provided `Dockerfile`, run:

```bash
docker build -t my-docker-image .
```

### Running a Docker Container

To run a Docker container from the built image, use:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 my-docker-image
```

### Accessing the Application

Once the container is running, you can access the application via the forwarded port in Codespaces. Typically, this will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Configuration

### Dockerfile

The `Dockerfile` in this repository is a simple example to get you started. Modify it according to your application's requirements.

### docker-compose.yml

If you need to manage multi-container Docker applications, you can use `docker-compose`. An example `docker-compose.yml` file is included for reference.
